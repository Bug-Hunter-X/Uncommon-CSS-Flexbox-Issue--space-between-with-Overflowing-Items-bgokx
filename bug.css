The following CSS code causes unexpected behavior in some browsers: .container { display: flex; justify-content: space-between; }  .item { width: 100px; }  This snippet intends to distribute three or more items evenly across a container. However, if the sum of item widths exceeds the container width, the space-between property might not work as expected, resulting in overlapping or unexpected item arrangement.
